"""023 -- Repair orphan ``ontology_object_properties`` ranges.

Backfills the missing ``rdfs_range_class`` edge for every object property
that has a live ``rdfs_domain`` edge but no live ``rdfs_range_class``
edge. The range class is inferred from the property's own
``description`` / ``evidence_text`` / ``source_spans`` by matching
existing class names -- see
``app.services.edge_repair.find_range_class_for_orphan`` for the rules
and ``app.services.edge_repair.repair_orphan_object_property_ranges``
for the orchestrator.

Why this exists
---------------

The extraction writer (``app.services.extraction``) writes the property
vertex + ``rdfs_domain`` edge unconditionally, but only writes the
``rdfs_range_class`` edge if the LLM-supplied ``target_class_uri``
resolves against an extracted class. When that resolution fails the
range edge is silently skipped, leaving the property orphaned and
invisible on the workspace canvas (which only draws class-to-class
links from paired ``rdfs_domain`` + ``rdfs_range_class``). A scan
across the demo ontologies showed 23 / 63 (37 %) of object properties
were orphans by this definition, of which 78 % could be auto-repaired
from the property's own recorded text.

This migration runs that auto-repair once on the existing data. The
companion pipeline fix (forthcoming) will prevent new orphans on the
next extraction.

Idempotent: running this migration a second time finds zero orphans
(the first run wrote the missing range edges, so the orphan filter no
longer matches them). Running it on a brand-new database with no
ontologies is a no-op.
