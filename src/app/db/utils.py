    """Insert a temporal edge iff no live edge with the same endpoint
    triple ``(_from, _to, ontology_id)`` already exists.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    Several extraction-pipeline writers (``rdfs_domain``,
    ``rdfs_range_class``, ``subclass_of``) historically issued bare
    ``collection.insert()`` calls without checking whether an
    existing live edge already represented the same logical
    relationship. Re-extracting the same class from a second
    document then duplicated the edge, leaving N>1 live rows where
    exactly one was expected. This broke downstream readers that
    assume "one edge per logical relationship" -- the workspace
    ``FloatingDetailPanel`` was the first to surface the symptom
    (React duplicate-key warning on the relationships list).

    The dedup-on-read pattern in
    :func:`app.api.ontology.get_class_detail` hides the symptom on
    the read side; this helper closes the bug on the write side so
    new extractions don't keep accumulating duplicate edges.

    Behaviour
    ---------
    Returns ``True`` if a new edge was inserted, ``False`` if an
    existing live edge was kept and no insert happened. Idempotent:
    safe to call from every extraction pass without coordinating
    between them.

    Notes
    -----
    This does NOT supersede an existing live edge. The contract for
    these structural edges is that the relationship carries no
    per-version state of its own (label / confidence / evidence
    live on the connected property document), so the original
    ``created`` timestamp is preserved -- the resulting provenance
    reads "this relationship has held since X" rather than "since
    the most recent re-extraction", which is more useful.

    For edges that DO carry per-version state (confidence, evidence,
    weight) use :func:`app.services.temporal.update_entity` instead;
    that path supersedes the prior version (expires it, inserts a
    new one) so the new payload becomes the live row.
