"""Make the repo root importable so ``benchmarks.ontology_extraction`` resolves.

The benchmark harness is intentionally outside ``backend/`` so it can run
against the AOE adapter (which imports the backend package) or against a mock
adapter without any backend dependencies. Pytest is invoked with
``rootdir=<repo root>`` in the make target; for ad-hoc ``pytest
benchmarks/...`` runs we prepend the repo root to ``sys.path`` here.
