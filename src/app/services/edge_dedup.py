"""Find and expire pre-existing duplicate live structural edges.

Companion to :func:`app.db.utils.insert_temporal_edge_if_absent` -- the
helper closes the duplicate-edge bug on the *write* side, but ontologies
extracted before that fix landed (see commit history around the
``FloatingDetailPanel`` duplicate-key warning) carry historical
duplicates that need a one-shot cleanup.

What counts as a "duplicate"
----------------------------

For the structural edges this module supports
(``rdfs_domain`` / ``rdfs_range_class``), a duplicate is any group
of >=2 live edges that share an identical
``(_from, _to, ontology_id)`` triple. Because these edges carry no
per-edge state (label / confidence / evidence live on the connected
property document, not on the edge), every member of such a group
represents the *same* logical relationship. Keeping all of them
breaks the "one edge per logical relationship" contract every
downstream reader assumes -- the workspace
``FloatingDetailPanel`` was the first to surface the symptom.

What we keep, what we expire
----------------------------

For each duplicate group we keep the edge with the **smallest
``created``** timestamp. Rationale: the earliest extraction
"discovered" the relationship, so its provenance reads "this
relationship has held since X" rather than "since the most recent
re-extraction" -- which matches the contract the
:func:`insert_temporal_edge_if_absent` writer now enforces going
forward. Tiebreaker on ``_key`` for determinism so re-running the
dedup against the same data produces identical reports.

Every expired edge is stamped with
``dedup_meta = {"source": DEDUP_SOURCE_MARKER, "reason":
"duplicate_pair"}`` so a future audit query (or undo migration)
can find every edge this module touched.

Scope
-----

Only collections in :data:`DEDUPABLE_COLLECTIONS` are accepted.
``subclass_of`` is intentionally excluded even though its bare
inserter has the same shape: that edge carries an ``evidence``
list and a future writer fix should *merge* evidence rather than
discard it -- a different problem with a different cleanup
contract. Including it here would silently drop evidence on the
floor.
