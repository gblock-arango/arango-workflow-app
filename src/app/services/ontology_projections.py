"""Field projections for ontology API responses.

Two projection profiles are supported by the workspace API:

``full``
    The legacy shape: every field on the document is returned. This is what
    detail panels, exporters, and provenance views need because they render
    ``evidence[]`` arrays, full ``description`` text, scoring breakdowns,
    and the ``_rev`` token.

``summary``
    A narrow allow-list of the fields the workspace canvas + asset explorer
    actually consume to paint nodes and edges. Specifically, ``evidence[]``
    and ``parent_evidence[]`` are dropped -- on the WTW Ontology those two
    fields make up **38 %** of the ``/classes`` payload (366 KB of 943 KB)
    and **22 %** of the ``/edges`` payload (133 KB of 581 KB), and neither
    is read by the canvas. ``embedding`` is also dropped as a defensive
    measure in case it is ever materialised onto class/edge documents
    (currently embeddings live on a side collection); a 1536-dim float
    vector serialises to ~12 KB per row.

Why allow-list rather than deny-list
------------------------------------

A deny-list ("everything except these three fields") would silently leak
any new heavy field a future writer adds. The allow-list makes the wire
contract for ``summary`` explicit and stable: when someone adds a new
field to the writer, the API response shape does not change until they
also extend this module. That keeps payload regressions reviewable.

Why project in AQL rather than Python
-------------------------------------

The backend talks to a remote ArangoDB over WAN. Projecting fields in
Python still pulls every byte across the WAN. The ``CLASS_SUMMARY_AQL``
and ``EDGE_SUMMARY_AQL`` projections push the allow-list into the
``RETURN { ... }`` clause so the bytes never leave Arango. Combined
with the in-Python helpers (used by single-item endpoints that already
have the full document in hand), every code path produces the same
shape.
