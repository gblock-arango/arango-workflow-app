"""Ontology rule engine for the belief-revision pipeline (Stream 11 IBR.4).

Implements PRD §6.16 / FR-16.7: a single AQL pass per ontology that
detects violations of four rule families, each registered as an
independent ``Rule`` function so new rules can be added without
touching the orchestrator.

Built-in rules
--------------

* **R1 -- Synonym Triangle.** If A ``subClassOf`` B and either
  A ``equivalent_class`` C or B ``equivalent_class`` C, the system
  expects the triangle to close: A should also be subClassOf C
  (or its synonym closure should). When the inferred edge is
  *missing*, the rule emits an ``inferred-missing`` violation;
  when the inferred edge would create a cycle (A subClassOf B and
  B equivalent A), it emits a ``synonym-cycle`` violation
  signalling a likely merge candidate.
* **R2 -- subClassOf Transitivity (Cycle Detection).** subClassOf
  must be a strict partial order. Any cycle (``A -> B -> A`` or
  longer) is a hard violation: the LLM extracted contradictory
  hierarchy. Detected via WCC on the ``subclass_of`` edge set.
* **R3 -- Orphan Object Property Range.** Object properties whose
  ``rdfs_domain`` edge is present but ``rdfs_range_class`` edge is
  missing are invisible on the workspace canvas (the synthetic-edge
  builder requires both endpoints). Wraps
  :func:`app.services.edge_repair.repair_orphan_object_property_ranges`
  in dry-run mode to surface every orphan along with its inferred
  range candidate (when the matcher finds one). Always
  ``GAP_FILLING`` -- the action is the same regardless of whether the
  matcher had a candidate; the difference is whether a curator can
  one-click apply or has to source new evidence.
* **R4 -- Redundant Class.** Two or more classes whose labels (or
  ``_key`` fragments when label is missing) collapse to the same
  normalised form -- lowercase, alphanumeric only, possessive ``'s``
  stripped, plus a conservative singular/plural pass that only
  merges ``S`` with ``S+"s"`` / ``S+"es"`` / ``S[:-1]+"ies"`` when
  *both* forms exist in the data. Catches the silent-duplicate case
  R1 cannot see (R1 needs explicit ``equivalent_class`` /
  ``subclass_of`` edges already in place). Suggested action is
  ``REDUNDANT`` -- the merge target choice belongs to the curator.
* **Disjointness.** When ``disjoint_with`` edges exist, any class C
  that is subClassOf both A and B (where A ``disjoint_with`` B) is
  a violation.
* **Cardinality.** When ``ontology_constraints`` documents declare
  cardinality bounds for a property, count actual occurrences and
  flag any class outside ``[min, max]``.

Output
------

``evaluate_rules`` returns a :class:`RuleEngineReport` containing a
list of :class:`Violation` records. Each violation has a stable
``rule_id``, a ``severity`` (``"warning"`` or ``"error"``), the
``entity_ids`` involved, a human-readable ``description``, and an
optional ``suggested_action`` (one of the belief-revision verdicts
from :mod:`app.db.revision_meta_repo`) so Phase 2's mechanical
classifier can read this directly.

def _r3_orphan_object_property_range(db: Any, ontology_id: str) -> list[Violation]:
    """Detect object properties missing their ``rdfs_range_class`` edge.

    An *orphan* object property has a live ``rdfs_domain`` edge but no
    live ``rdfs_range_class`` edge (or, in the worst case, has neither).
    Such properties are invisible on the workspace canvas because the
    synthetic-edge builder
    (``frontend/src/components/graph/graphCanvasEdges.ts::buildSyntheticRdfsRangeClassEdges``)
    requires both endpoints to emit a class-to-class edge.

    Wraps :func:`app.services.edge_repair.repair_orphan_object_property_ranges`
    in dry-run mode and converts each item in the report into a
    :class:`Violation`. Three cases:

    * **Repairable orphan** (``severity=warning``,
      ``suggested_action=GAP-FILLING``): the matcher inferred a range
      class candidate from the property's own description / evidence
      text. A curator can one-click apply via
      ``POST /admin/ontology/{id}/repair-edges``.
    * **Unrecoverable orphan** (``severity=warning``,
      ``suggested_action=GAP-FILLING``): no candidate was found; the
      gap requires either new evidence or human curation.
    * **Structurally broken** (``severity=error``,
      ``suggested_action=GAP-FILLING``): the property has neither
      domain nor range; it is unusable as currently extracted.

    Reuses ``edge_repair`` instead of re-implementing the AQL so the
    "what counts as an orphan" definition stays in one place; if it
    ever changes (e.g. to allow data-property ranges), only one
    module needs to update.

    """Detect classes that look like silent duplicates of each other.

    Two classes are considered redundant when their labels (or, when
    the label is missing, their ``_key`` fragments) collapse to the
    same normalised form. Normalisation is the same one used by
    :mod:`app.services.edge_repair` -- lowercase + strip
    non-alphanumerics + drop possessive ``'s``. So
    ``"Customer's Risk Profile"`` and ``"CustomerRiskProfile"``
    both collapse to ``customerriskprofile``.

    On top of exact-form clustering, a conservative singular/plural
    pass merges any cluster whose normalised form ``S`` has another
    cluster whose form is one of ``S+"s"``, ``S+"es"``, or
    ``S[:-1]+"ies"`` -- but *only when both forms exist in the data*.
    This avoids over-aggressive stemming (``Address`` would otherwise
    incorrectly stem to ``Addres``) while still catching the common
    ``Employee/Employees``, ``Class/Classes``, ``Country/Countries``
    duplicates the user demo-flagged.

    Distinct from R1 (synonym triangle) -- R1 needs explicit
    ``equivalent_class`` / ``subclass_of`` edges already in place and
    detects inconsistencies in those triangles. R4 needs no edges and
    detects the class-was-extracted-twice case the LLM is prone to.

    Each cluster of size >= 2 emits one ``warning`` violation with
    ``suggested_action=REDUNDANT``. The merge target choice belongs
    to the curator (the rule has no opinion on which member to
    keep), so we do not pre-select one in the description.
