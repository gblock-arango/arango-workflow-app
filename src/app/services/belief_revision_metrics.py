"""Read-only aggregation helpers for the belief-revision dashboard
(Stream 11 IBR.6 telemetry hooks).

These functions back the ``GET /api/v1/quality/{ontology_id}/revisions``
endpoint specified in PRD §7.7a. They are intentionally read-only and
cheap -- the dashboard polls them frequently, so every helper is
implemented as a single AQL pass with bounded result size.

All functions degrade gracefully when ``revision_meta`` does not yet
exist (e.g. on freshly-migrated ontologies that have not yet had a
revision recorded). They return zero-filled structures rather than
raising, so the dashboard never sees a 5xx because of an empty
collection.
