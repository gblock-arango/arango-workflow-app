# setup-dual-push-remotes.sh — one-shot reconfiguration of git remotes for
# the "personal fork = active dev, org repo = release artifact" workflow.
#
# Reconfigures the local clone's remotes so that:
#   origin    -> personal fork           (default for `git push`)
#   upstream  -> org/release repo        (explicit pushes only)
#
# Detects and fixes the common dual-push misconfiguration where origin has
# multiple push URLs (one for fork, one for org). After this script runs,
# `git push` only ever hits the personal fork.
#
# Idempotent: rerun safely.
#
# Configuration (env vars; sane defaults for arango-ontoextract):
#   ORIGIN_URL       URL the personal fork (origin) should fetch+push to.
#                    Default: derived from current origin's fetch URL if
#                    it already points at a personal fork pattern; else
#                    error and ask user to set explicitly.
#   UPSTREAM_URL     URL the org/release remote should fetch+push to.
#                    Default: discovered by scanning existing remotes for
#                    one matching UPSTREAM_PROTECTED_URL_PATTERN; else
#                    error and ask user to set explicitly.
#   UPSTREAM_PROTECTED_URL_PATTERN
#                    Substring used both for discovery and as the value
#                    saved into the protect-upstream-push.sh hook config.
#                    Default: "arango-solutions/"
#   UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME
#                    What to name the protected remote.
#                    Default: "upstream" (GitHub fork-workflow convention)
#   DROP_REMOTES     Space-separated list of remote names to remove if
#                    present (cleanup of legacy remotes).
#                    Default: "" (don't remove anything)
