#!/usr/bin/env bash
# protect-upstream-push.sh — pre-push hook that gates pushes to a protected
# upstream remote (typically the org/release repo) so that only tagged
# releases on `main` can land there.
#
# Designed to be invoked by the pre-commit framework as a `stages: [pre-push]`
# local hook. Pre-commit calls this script with NO stdin (it has already
# consumed git's pre-push stdin) and exposes the push context via env vars:
#
#   PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_NAME    e.g. "upstream"
#   PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_URL     e.g. "https://github.com/arango-solutions/foo.git"
#   PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_BRANCH  e.g. "refs/heads/main" or "refs/tags/v1.0.0"
#   PRE_COMMIT_LOCAL_BRANCH   e.g. "refs/heads/main"
#   PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF         the local sha being pushed
#
# Limitation inherited from the pre-commit framework: only the FIRST push
# record from `git push`'s stdin is reflected here. Single-ref pushes
# (the realistic case — `git push upstream main` or `git push upstream feat/x`)
# are fully covered. For `git push --all upstream` only the first ref is
# inspected; rely on `make release-to-org` (which only ever pushes a tag
# and main) and on GitHub-side rules for `--all`/`--mirror` defence.
#
# Configuration (env vars; defaults sized for arango-ontoextract):
#   UPSTREAM_PROTECTED_URL_PATTERN   substring matched against the remote URL
#                                    Default: "arango-solutions/"
#   UPSTREAM_PROTECTED_BRANCH        protected branch on upstream
#                                    Default: "main"
#   UPSTREAM_RELEASE_TAG_PATTERN     ERE matching valid release tags
#                                    Default: "^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$"
#   ALLOW_UPSTREAM_PUSH              set to "1" to bypass (escape hatch;
#                                    surfaced in the refusal message)
#
# Behaviour:
#   • Remote URL doesn't match pattern  → silent allow (your personal fork)
#   • ALLOW_UPSTREAM_PUSH=1             → loud allow (escape hatch)
#   • Pushing a release tag (TAG_REGEX) → allow
#   • Pushing a non-protected branch    → allow (PR-style branches OK)
#   • Pushing protected branch when
#       HEAD has a release tag pointing
#       at it                           → allow (this IS a release)
#   • Anything else                     → refuse with a helpful message
#
# Direct invocation (for testing) is supported:
#   PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_URL=... PRE_COMMIT_REMOTE_BRANCH=refs/heads/main \
#     PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
#     scripts/githooks/protect-upstream-push.sh

  • ${refusal}

Pushes to this remote's '${PROTECTED_BRANCH}' branch are reserved for
tagged releases. To cut a release:

    make release-to-org TAG=vX.Y.Z

To push a feature branch for review, push that branch by name (not '${PROTECTED_BRANCH}')
and open a PR on GitHub.

Emergency bypass (avoid for WIP):
    ALLOW_UPSTREAM_PUSH=1 git push ${remote_name:-<remote>} <ref>
